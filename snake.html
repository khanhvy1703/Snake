            &emsp;The users control the direction of the snake's head
            <img src="/head.png" alt="snake's head" /> by using the arrows key
            and make the snake eat the food <img src="/food.png" alt="food" />.
            The users can't stop the snake while the game is in process.
            <br />
            &emsp;The snake's tail will grow up and be longer every time it eats
            the food. The score will be increased by 1.
            <br />
            &emsp;However, there is a poison food
            <img src="/poison.png" alt="poison" /> on the map. If the snake eats
            the poison food, it will lose one tail and the score will be
            decreased by 1.
            <br />
            &emsp;The game will be over if the snake eats itself or hits the
            wall.
